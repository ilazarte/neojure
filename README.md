# neojure

	This is an nvd3 wip wrapper for Clojurescript.
	The goal is minimal, wrap a few common cases such as pie, bar, scatter, line etc.
	Ideally these all will be setup for easy realtime access as well.
	At this point, work and api is really early.

## Usage

	Requires nvd3 and d3.
	If lein-npm accepts my pull request I'll add d3 and nvd3 versions to project.clj
